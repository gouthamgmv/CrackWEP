How to compile the source file;

1) Run make.
2) Use the command ./crack <log file name>

What works:

The program successfully retrieves the WEP keys from the five log files.

Obstacles encountered:

The primary obstacle encountered was actually reading the log files properly and making sense out of them. This was made easier by the sample code provided by the instructor.

Keys obtained:

enemy (from log1.wep)
point (from log2.wep)
court (from log3.wep)
chief (from log4.wep)
white (from log5.wep)
